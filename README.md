# EarthDefense
A Project for Dad and Son to Learn Together

________________________________________________________
We are going to make a browser game together!
Time travelling aliens are invading earth, and you
have to save us all before it's too late...or...early
as the case may be. You have to fight off the aliens
throughout different time periods and in different places
all over the world with the help of some of human-kind's
greatest civilizations.

Goals for Garrett (dad)
1. Learn new languages and tools
2. Build a portfolio of projects for future jobs
3. Build a dev machine and environment from the ground up
4. Have fun! :-)

Goals for Ethan (son)
1. Learn about technology:
	What is a computer made of?
	How does a computer work?
	What is the Internet?
	What is hardware and software?
	... and so much more!
2. Learn about world history:
	Research the major civilizations of the world
3. Practice typing:
	Ethan is going to type information about each
	civilization that he researches. Garrett is 
	going to build (with Ethan's help) a website to 
	house the game and various informational webpages 
	about the different civilizations.
4. Gain confidence:
	Ethan will have something cool to show his friends
	and family, something that he made and that others can
	use. He'll be able to explain some pretty dang complex
	technological concepts! And he will feel confident
	enough to explore things on his own.
5. HAVE FUN!!! :-)
